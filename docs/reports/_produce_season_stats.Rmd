This `r paste0("[season's]", "(", summary_url, ")")` games were played between `r season_dates`.

`r num_players` players participated, `r num_rookies` (`r round(perc_rookies * 100)`%) of whom were new to the league.

`r glue::glue(ifelse(league == 'team4545', "{(num_matches / 8) * 2} teams played {num_matches} matches over the season's eight weeks. {num_drawn} matches ({round(perc_drawn*100, 0)}%) were drawn, and {num_close} ({round(perc_close*100, 0)}%) were won by just a single point.", ""))`

In all, `r formatC(nrow(website_pairings), big.mark = ",")` games were played over the season. The season's 'unplayed pairing' rate was `r round(((nrow(pairings) - nrow(website_pairings)) / nrow(pairings)) * 100, 1)`%.^[There are several reasons why a pairing might not end up being played, including scheduling difficulties, a lack of available replacements, or one of the players not showing up at the start time!]

White won `r formatC(games_w, big.mark=",")` games (`r round(perc_w*100, 1)`%), `r formatC(games_d, big.mark=",")` games (`r round(perc_d*100, 1)`%) were drawn, and Black won `r formatC(games_b, big.mark=",")` games (`r round(perc_b*100, 1)`%). The right-hand chart shows game results by colour for each board or average rating band.^[The number of games played in this statistic can differ from the number of games played in the season, as it excludes games where the result of the pairing was later changed to a forfeit win or loss.]

Here are the top three player performances on each board (min. 5 games played). Click on the arrows next to each board number to see more details.^[Similar to the "official" board performance tables on the Lichess4545 website, board rankings are determined by performance rating alone.

#### Top gambits

The most played gambits over the season.^[For these statistics, a played opening line is termed a gambit if it arises from an opening or variation that's commonly associated with one side sacrificing some material in the opening (in return for compensation) *and* the side that played the gambit actually sacrificed material in the game (for at least 5 consecutive half-moves before move 16). In particular, the list of gambit openings isn't restricted to named gambits; it also includes for example the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez, the Budapest Defence, and several variations of the Two Knights Defence in the Italian Game. However, this approach excludes games where a side decides to gambit material when *not* playing a traditionally gambit-associated opening. Yes, those should be considered gambits. But they're not here.]

### Awards 

<!-- All the code to determine the awards has to be run before the awards table -->

 
Assorted awards to celebrate the season - see the footnote for more details.[^awards]

[^awards]: **Aces**: all players who achieved a plus/minus score - wins minus losses - of +6 or better over the season. **Archbishop of Accuracy**: the player with the lowest average centipawn loss (ACPL) over the season, accounting for moves played. **Giri Award**: named for [Anish Giri](https://chess24.com/en/read/news/giri-s-60-memorable-draws-exclusive-excerpt). **Grischuk's Cousin**: named for [Alexander Grischuk](https://www.chessbase.in/news/Candidates-2020-21-Round-10). **Houdini Award**: the player with the most comeback "points" over the season - players earn 1 point for winning a game after being in a position with an evaluation worse than -6, 0.7 points for winning after being worse than -3, 0.5 points for drawing after being worse than -6, and 0.3 points for drawing after being worse than -3. **MVP Award**: players must play at least five games to qualify, and perf. ratings are calculated using FIDE's method. **Primates of Precision**: based on Lichess game analysis ACPLs. **Rookie Award**: to be eligible, players must have played at least four games in the season and not have played in any previous league season. **Tarjan Award**: named for James Tarjan, who [famously defeated Vladimir Kramnik in 2017](https://www.chess.com/news/view/3-year-old-tarjan-beats-kramnik-in-battle-of-generations). **David Award**: the player whose opponents achieved the highest percentage score across the season, excluding games against the player. To be eligible, a player must have played at least 5 games over the season, and their opponents must have collectively played at least 30 games against others. **Egalitarian Award**: the team with the lowest standard deviation across players' relative performance ratings. *Other*: all other awards should be self-explanatory.

#### Best performances / highest accuracy {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 


##### Best relative performances

This table shows players' *relative* performance ratings -- that is, their performance rating over the season minus their initial rating before their first game.^[The season performance ratings presented in this report may differ slightly from ratings published on the Lichess4545 website, but both calculations are based on FIDE's preferred method, and both exclude unplayed games such as forfeit wins/losses and scheduling draws.] *Includes everyone with a positive relative performance rating over at least five games.*

##### Lowest ACPL 

All players who played at least five games and achieved a season ACPL in the 20th percentile or below. Note that 'season ACPL' differs from Lichess game-wide ACPL figures, as it excludes opening moves as well as most moves played in objectively decided positions. See the footnote for full details.^[Season ACPL here excludes the first 10 moves of a game, all zero-CPL moves played in zero-evaluation positions, and moves played in positions where one side has an advantage of +300 centipawns or greater *that aren't mistakes or blunders*.] ACPLs based on Lichess's published figures are provided for comparison purposes.

```{r show_lowest_acpls}

#### Time spent / strongest opponents {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

##### Time spent

The 50 players who spent the most clock time over the season.

##### Strength of schedule

The players who faced the best-scoring opponents over the season, when judged by their collective score over all their *other* games. *Suggested by Tranzoo.*

```{r}

```



#### Comebacks and upsets {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

##### Comebacks 

The players who achieved the most significant comeback wins and draws over the season.^[I award "comeback points" for each game that a player won after their opponent had an advantage of at least 300 centipawns, according to Lichess' server analysis. The scoring is rather simple. A win after suffering an evaluation disadvantage of more than 6 pawns earns 1 point. A win after being down by 3-6 pawns earns 0.7 points. A draw after being down more than 6 pawns earns 0.5 points. A draw after being down 3-6 pawns earns 0.3 points. Then the points are added up.] *Suggested by Lou-E.*
