### FYIs

- [Feb 2022] I still need to update most of the existing LoneWolf season reports to reflect necessary revisions to the computation of gambit-related stats and awards. These changes have already been reflected in all 4545 reports (except S1), and aren't applicable to the Chess960 league. 



### Recent updates

#### February 2022

- Published the latest stats for the LoneWolf league (season 24)
- Re-designed the homepage

#### January 2022

- Improved live standings page; still only works for 4545, and still not properly automated
- Published season stats and awards for the Chess960 league
- Published article on where league players come from, using the flags they choose to show on their Lichess profiles
- Published the latest stats for the 4545 Team league (season 28)

#### August 2021

- Site first published


### Future ideas

Consider this a form of motivation through public commitment. In other words, these might be done next week, next month, next year...or never.

- Adding new leagues: ~~Chess960~~ Series, Rapid Battle (yes, I know I've been promising these for ages)
- Reporting all-time stats, records and trivia
- Team logo gallery
- Stats about league openings
- Stats about endgames reached in league games, Ã  la *100 Endgames You Must Know*
- Stats about 7-piece tablebase positions reached in league games...and their outcomes

#### Stupidly ambitious ideas

- A world map showing connections between players (a version for live games definitely can't be done, but even a static version based on historical data is ambitious and magnificently pointless)
