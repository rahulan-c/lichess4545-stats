# Identify all seasons for which stats reports have been compiled 
completed <- list.files(path = "reports/", pattern = "^stats_(.*)\\.html$") %>% 
  str_remove_all("stats_") %>% 
  str_remove_all("\\.html") %>% 
  sort()

completed <- tibble("season" = completed)

# Convert to URLs
completed <- completed %>% 
  mutate(Seasons = paste0("[", season, "]", "(", "https://rahulan-c.github.io/lichess4545-stats/reports/stats_", season, ".html", ")")) %>%
