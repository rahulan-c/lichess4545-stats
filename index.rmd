If you're looking for stats covering previous seasons of the [Lichess4545](https://www.lichess4545.com/) [Team](https://www.lichess4545.com/team4545/) (45+45) and [LoneWolf](https://www.lichess4545.com/lonewolf/) (30+30) online chess leagues, you're in the right place.

Here's a list of the seasons covered so far:

```{r}

completed_seasons <- c("4545_s20")

completed <- tibble("League/Season" = completed_seasons)

completed <- completed %>% 
  mutate(Links = paste0("[", "Link", "]", "(", "https://rahulan-c.github.io/lichess4545-stats/reports/stats_", completed_seasons, ".html", ")"))

knitr::kable(completed)
```
