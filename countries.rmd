Here are some rough estimates of league players by country and continent, based on all classical league games played to date (January 2022). They're purely based on the national flags shown on league members' Lichess profile pages, which means that they definitely won't be perfect, since many players don't have a flag on their profile page (so they're excluded), and others prefer to display a non-national flag (so they're also excluded). Moreover, players can show any flag they want...which may well explain some of the countries listed in the results. `r emo::ji("laugh")`
