This round's games were played between `r round_dates`.

`r num_players` players participated.

`r glue::glue(ifelse(league == 'team4545', "{(num_matches / 8) * 2} teams played {num_matches} matches over the season's eight weeks. {num_drawn} matches ({round(perc_drawn*100, 0)}%) were drawn, and {num_close} ({round(perc_close*100, 0)}%) were won by just a single point.", ""))`

In all, `r formatC(nrow(website_pairings), big.mark = ",")` games were played in the season. The round's 'unplayed pairing' rate was `r round(((nrow(pairings) - nrow(website_pairings)) / nrow(pairings)) * 100, 1)`%.^[There are several reasons why a pairing might not end up being played, including scheduling difficulties, a lack of available replacements, or one of the players not showing up at the start time!]

White won `r formatC(games_w, big.mark=",")` games (`r round(perc_w*100, 1)`%), `r formatC(games_d, big.mark=",")` games (`r round(perc_d*100, 1)`%) were drawn, and Black won `r formatC(games_b, big.mark=",")` games (`r round(perc_b*100, 1)`%). The right-hand chart shows game results by colour for each board or average rating band.^[The number of games played in this statistic can differ from the number of games played in the season, as it excludes games where the result of the pairing was later changed to a forfeit win or loss.]
