### Overview

perc_w <- wdl %>% filter(result == "1-0") %>% dplyr::pull(perc)
games_b <- wdl %>% filter(result == "0-1") %>% dplyr::pull(n)
perc_b <- wdl %>% filter(result == "0-1") %>% dplyr::pull(perc)
games_d <- wdl %>% filter(result == "1/2-1/2") %>% dplyr::pull(n)
perc_d <- wdl %>% filter(result == "1/2-1/2") %>% dplyr::pull(perc)

# Identify season summary URL
summary_url <- paste0("https://www.lichess4545.com/",
                        league, "/season/",
                        season, 
                        "/summary/")

# Get numbers of season players for reporting
num_players <- length(unique(c(unique(website_pairings$white), unique(website_pairings$black))))
num_rookies <- NewPlayers(games = games, all_games = all_games)
perc_rookies <- num_rookies / num_players
num_veterans <- num_players - num_rookies
num_players <- formatC(num_players, big.mark = ",")
num_rookies <- formatC(num_rookies, big.mark = ",")

```

This `r paste0("[season's]", "(", summary_url, ")")` games were played between `r season_dates`.

`r num_players` players participated, `r num_rookies` (`r round(perc_rookies * 100)`%) of whom were new to the league.

`r formatC(nrow(website_pairings), big.mark = ",")` games were played: White won `r formatC(games_w, big.mark=",")` games (`r round(perc_w*100, 1)`%), `r formatC(games_d, big.mark=",")` games (`r round(perc_d*100, 1)`%) were drawn, and Black won `r formatC(games_b, big.mark=",")` games (`r round(perc_b*100, 1)`%). The season's 'unplayed pairing' rate was `r round(((nrow(pairings) - nrow(website_pairings)) / nrow(pairings)) * 100, 1)`%.

### Awards `r emo::ji("prize")`

<!-- All the code to determine the awards has to be run before the awards table -->

 
Assorted awards to celebrate the season - see the footnote for more details.[^awards]

[^awards]: **Aces**: all players who achieved a plus/minus score - wins minus losses - of +6 or better over the season. **Archbishop of Accuracy**: the player with the lowest average centipawn loss (ACPL) over the season, accounting for moves played. For the Chess960 league stats, these calculations are based on Lichess game analysis figures, which are in turn sourced from Lichess server analysis. Players must play at least five games in the season to qualify. **Giri Award**: named for [Anish Giri](https://chess24.com/en/read/news/giri-s-60-memorable-draws-exclusive-excerpt). **Grischuk's Cousin**: named for [Alexander Grischuk](https://www.chessbase.in/news/Candidates-2020-21-Round-10). **Houdini Award**: the player with the most comeback "points" over the season - players earn 1 point for winning a game after being in a position with an evaluation worse than -6, 0.7 points for winning after being worse than -3, 0.5 points for drawing after being worse than -6, and 0.3 points for drawing after being worse than -3. **MVP Award**: players must play at least five games to qualify, and perf. ratings are calculated using FIDE's method. **Primates of Precision**: based on Lichess game analysis ACPLs. **Rookie Award**: to be eligible, players must have played at least four games in the season and not have played in any previous 960 league season. **Tarjan Award**: named for James Tarjan, who [famously defeated Vladimir Kramnik in 2017](https://www.chess.com/news/view/3-year-old-tarjan-beats-kramnik-in-battle-of-generations). *Other*: all other awards should be self-explanatory.

### Stats `r emo::ji("books")` {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 


#### Best relative performances

This table shows players' *relative* performance ratings -- that is, their performance rating over the season minus their initial rating before their first game.^[The season performance ratings presented in this report may differ slightly from ratings published on the Lichess4545 website, but both calculations are based on FIDE's preferred method, and both exclude unplayed games such as forfeit wins/losses and scheduling draws.] *Includes everyone with a positive relative performance rating over at least five games.*

```{r}
# Table for report
reactable(relative_perfs,
          pagination = TRUE, 
          fullWidth = TRUE,

#### Lowest ACPL 

All players who played at least five games and achieved a season ACPL in the 20th percentile or below.

The 10 players who spent the most clock time over the season.

Everyone who defeated an opponent who outrated them by at least 100 points.
