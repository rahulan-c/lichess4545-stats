These "live" standings account for games that have already been played in the current round. They show how each team's ranking would change if all matches ended at their current score. 

However, the standings don't account for all the tiebreaks used in the [official standings](https://www.lichess4545.com/team4545/standings), so I can't guarantee that the rankings shown here will always be accurate. Also, this page doesn't get updated automatically (yet), so there's a good chance that at any given time, it will be showing outdated information.
