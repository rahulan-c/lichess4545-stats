Welcome to my (unofficial) stats site for the [Lichess4545](https://www.lichess4545.com) online chess leagues.

Here you'll find [detailed reports](season_stats.html) on every season of the Team (4545), LoneWolf and Chess960 leagues, providing a detailed overview of each season while celebrating noteworthy performances through a range of whimsically named awards. There's also a page that lists [all award winners](awards_search.html) across all leagues and seasons in a easy to search format.
