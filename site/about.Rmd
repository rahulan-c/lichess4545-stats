### FYIs

- Still need to update most LW season reports to reflect necessary revisions to the computation of gambit-related stats and awards. These changes have already been reflected in all 4545 reports except S1, and aren't applicable to the Chess960 league. 


### Recent updates

- Published stats for 4545 S29 [Mar '22]
- Published stats for LoneWolf S24 [Feb '22]
- Re-designed homepage
- Improved live standings [Jan '22]
- Published stats for all Chess960 seasons
- Published article on the estimated global distribution of league players
- Published stats for 4545 S28
- Site first published [Aug '21]


### Future ideas

Consider this a form of motivation through public commitment. In other words, these might be done next week, next month, next year...or never.

- Adding new leagues: ~~Chess960~~ Series, Rapid Battle (yes, I know I've been promising these for ages)
- Reporting all-time stats, records and trivia
- Team logo gallery
- Stats about league openings
- Stats about endgames reached in league games, Ã  la *100 Endgames You Must Know*
- Stats about 7-piece tablebase positions reached in league games...and their outcomes
