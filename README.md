## Can these stats be replicated?

Yes, but not entirely. 

The only step that can't be replicated is where a given season's data is filtered to remove any game or pairing involving a player banned on Lichess for ToS violations. This requires access to non-public data that hasn't been uploaded to this repository.

Everthing else is replicable.
