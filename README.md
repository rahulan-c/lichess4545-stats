# lichess4545-stats

Stats for previous Lichess4545 Team and LoneWolf seasons, published [here](https://rahulan-c.github.io/lichess4545-stats/). Originally produced for the [Lichess4545 Ledger](https://www.lichess4545.com/team4545/document/ledger-144/). 

## How to replicate

*NOTE: it's impossible to perfectly replicate the stats on the website, as the script that produces the final report for a given season first excludes any player that's been banned by Lichess for ToS violations, even if they were banned after the season ended. The script does this by referring to a dataset that cannot be made public, for obvious reasons. This is the only non-replicable aspect of the process.*
