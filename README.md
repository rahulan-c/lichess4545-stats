# lichess4545-stats

This stuff produces HTML reports summarising Lichess4545 Team and LoneWolf league seasons.

Each report provides a high-level overview of the season (when games were played, how many were won by White etc) but also gives detailed stats on popular openings, performance by board / rating band, and player statistics on a wide range of measures including relative performance rating, move times, average centipawn loss...

## What's in the repo? 

TBC.

## Will I get the same results if I run this code?

No...but only because after extracting data on games/pairings for a given season, the code excludes all players who were banned from the Lichess4545 leagues for violating Lichess's Terms of Service. It does this by referring to non-public data which shouldn't be exposed here. Sorry about that.

In all other respects, you should be able to replicate the stats reports by doing the following:
